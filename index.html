        <h3>From Sarah J Mass' series "A COURT OF THORNS AND ROSES"</h3>
        <p>
          Velaris, also known as the Court of Dreams and the City of Starlight,
          is a hidden city on the western side of the Night Court of Prythian.
          Its inhabitants agree that Rhysand be their High Lord despite the fact
          that he is not fully High Fae being half Illyrian, whom their
          counterparts the inhabitants of the Court of Nightmares consider
          Lesser Faeries, it is for this reason that the inhabitants of said
          Court do not approve of him. The city remained hidden from Amarantha,
          thanks to Rhysand's fifty year sacrifice Under the Mountain. The walls
          of Velaris had not been breached in over five thousand years.
