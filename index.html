      <h3>From Sarah J Mass' series "A COURT OF THORNS AND ROSES"</h3>
      <p>
        Velaris, also known as the Court of Dreams and the City of Starlight, is
        a hidden city on the western side of the Night Court of Prythian. Its
        inhabitants agree that Rhysand be their High Lord despite the fact that
        he is not fully High Fae being half Illyrian, whom their counterparts
        the inhabitants of the Court of Nightmares consider Lesser Faeries, it
        is for this reason that the inhabitants of said Court do not approve of
        him. The city remained hidden from Amarantha, thanks to Rhysand's fifty
        year sacrifice Under the Mountain. The walls of Velaris had not been
        breached in over five thousand years.

        <h2>The Hewn city</h2>
        <p>
          The Hewn City, also known as the Court of Nightmares, is one of the
          two main cities of the Night Court of Prythian. It's located under the
          mountains of the Night Court and is the domain of High Lord Rhysand.

          alt="woman screaming"
        />
        <p>
          Unlike Under the Mountain, which was a series of halls and rooms and
          levels, the Hewn City is a true city within the mountain. There are
          avenues, separate buildings with spires, homes, and bridges. It is an
          entire metropolis carved from the dark stone of the mountain itself.
          Every surface is carved with lovely, hideous artwork: figures dance
          and fornicate, beg and revel, pillars are carved to look like curling
          vines of night-blooming flowers. Water runs throughout the city in
          little streams and rivers tapped from the heart of the mountain
          itself. The mountain-city is lit with silvery bobbing faelights. The
          Hewn City is ruled from a castle inside the mountain, which is the
          official seat of the High Lord of the Night Court. The gates to the
          castle are carved into great, scaled black beasts coiled together in a
          nest of claws and fangs, sleeping and fighting or devouring each
          other. Between them flow vines of jasmine and moonflowers. The throne
          room within is of polished ebony on every surface, the floor highly
          polished enough Feyre could see her face in it when she kneeled and
          lowered her head. More of the beasts from the gates are carved around
          the countless columns supporting the onyx ceiling, which is so high
          the gloom hides its finer details. Atop a dais is a throne that has
          been fashioned out of a few of the beasts, a head snaking around
          either side of the back as if they watch over the High Lord's
          shoulders. The castle's council chambers was nearly as large as its
          throne room. It was carved from the same dark rock, pillars fashioned
          after those entangled beasts, having a high domed ceiling. It had a
          mammoth table of black glass that split the room in two, shaped a bit
          like a lightning bolt. The table's corners were left long and jagged
          so they were as sharp as a razor, capable of injury if one was not
          careful.
