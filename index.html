      <h3>From Sarah J Mass' series "A COURT OF THORNS AND ROSES"</h3>
      <p>
        Velaris, also known as the Court of Dreams and the City of Starlight, is
        a hidden city on the western side of the Night Court of Prythian. Its
        inhabitants agree that Rhysand be their High Lord despite the fact that
        he is not fully High Fae being half Illyrian, whom their counterparts
        the inhabitants of the Court of Nightmares consider Lesser Faeries, it
        is for this reason that the inhabitants of said Court do not approve of
        him. The city remained hidden from Amarantha, thanks to Rhysand's fifty
        year sacrifice Under the Mountain. The walls of Velaris had not been
        breached in over five thousand years.
      </p>
      <div>
        <div class="description">
          <p>
            Velaris had been built like a crust atop the rolling, steep hills
            are flanked by a broad, winding river, sparkling like deepest
            sapphire - the Sidra River - and snaking toward the vast expanse of
            water beyond, the sea. The Sidra River is loitered by ships with
            sails of varying shapes, making it navigable. At the northern edge
            of Velaris, curved to where the river bent toward them and flowed
            into their shadows, tower, like eternal guardians of the city, a
            wall of flat-topped mountains of red stone. Their middle and larger
            peak has holes and windows built in the uppermost part of it, in
            fact, there is where resides the House of Wind, Rhysand's house for
            official business. To the north different kinds of mountains
            surrounded the city across the river, a range of sharp peaks like
            fish's teeth cleaved the city's hills from the sea beyond. The
            city's buildings are crafted out of white marble, warm sandstone,
            and the same red stone of the flat-topped mountains that can be
            found on the northern edge of the city. Many quarters of Velaris are
            full of townhouses with green copper roofs and white chimneys. In
            Velaris many shops can be found with delicate tables and chairs
            scattered outside their cheery fronts, restaurants like the
            Restaurant where the Inner Circle go dining, and nightclubs like the
            Rita's. Many of these buildings are heated by warming spells.
            Velaris has four market squares called Palaces, two on the southern
            side of the Sidra River and two on the northern side. We know the
            name of only three of the four squares: the Palace of Thread and
            Jewels and the Palace of Bone and Salt that sell respectively jewels
            and food and are positioned on the southern side of the Sidra River,
            and, the Palace of Hoof and Leaf positioned on the northern side of
            the Sidra River and twin square to the Palace of Bone and Salt. They
            are white-stoned squares flanked by Tehran pillars supporting the
            carved and painted buildings that watch over them and provide a
            covered walkway beneath the shops built into the street level. What
            Velaris is most known for is the artists' quarter, called the
            Rainbow of Velaris, where dwell the performing artists, the
            musicians, the dancers, the actors. It is a brightly painted pocket
            of the city, built atop one of the hills that flowed right to the
            river's edge. In the Rainbow of Velaris can be found a hundred
            galleries, supply stores, potters' compounds, sculpture gardens, and
            anything in between. In this quarter is located a building with a
            golden top, the most famous of the five main theaters in the city.
            In Velaris there are also other smaller theaters and an amphitheater
            on the sea cliff.

          "This is what Velaris is known for: the artists' quarter. You'll find
          a hundred galleries, supply stores, potters' compounds, sculpture
          gardens, and anything in between. They call it the Rainbow of

          The Rainbow of Velaris is a neighborhood in the city of Velaris in the
          Night Court. It is the central hub for different kinds of art. It
          contains the most famous theater in the city. Description The Rainbow
          of Velaris is Velaris's artists' quarter, home to the performing
          artists: the musicians, the dancers, the actors. It is a brightly
          painted pocket of the city, built atop one of the hills that flowed
          right to the Sidra River's edge. In the Rainbow of Velaris can be
          found a hundred galleries, supply stores, potters' compounds,
          sculpture gardens, and anything in between. In this quarter is located
          a building with a golden top, the most famous of the five main
          theaters in the city. In Velaris there are also other smaller theaters
          and an amphitheater on the sea cliffs.

        <h2>The Hewn city</h2>
        <p>
          The Hewn City, also known as the Court of Nightmares, is one of the
          two main cities of the Night Court of Prythian. It's located under the
          mountains of the Night Court and is the domain of High Lord Rhysand.
        </p>

          alt="woman screaming"

        <p>
          Unlike Under the Mountain, which was a series of halls and rooms and
          levels, the Hewn City is a true city within the mountain. There are
          avenues, separate buildings with spires, homes, and bridges. It is an
          entire metropolis carved from the dark stone of the mountain itself.
          Every surface is carved with lovely, hideous artwork: figures dance
          and fornicate, beg and revel, pillars are carved to look like curling
          vines of night-blooming flowers. Water runs throughout the city in
          little streams and rivers tapped from the heart of the mountain
          itself. The mountain-city is lit with silvery bobbing faelights. The
          Hewn City is ruled from a castle inside the mountain, which is the
          official seat of the High Lord of the Night Court. The gates to the
          castle are carved into great, scaled black beasts coiled together in a
          nest of claws and fangs, sleeping and fighting or devouring each
          other. Between them flow vines of jasmine and moonflowers. The throne
          room within is of polished ebony on every surface, the floor highly
          polished enough Feyre could see her face in it when she kneeled and
          lowered her head. More of the beasts from the gates are carved around
          the countless columns supporting the onyx ceiling, which is so high
          the gloom hides its finer details. Atop a dais is a throne that has
          been fashioned out of a few of the beasts, a head snaking around
          either side of the back as if they watch over the High Lord's
          shoulders. The castle's council chambers was nearly as large as its
          throne room. It was carved from the same dark rock, pillars fashioned
          after those entangled beasts, having a high domed ceiling. It had a
          mammoth table of black glass that split the room in two, shaped a bit
          like a lightning bolt. The table's corners were left long and jagged
          so they were as sharp as a razor, capable of injury if one was not
          careful.
